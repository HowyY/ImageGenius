[SCENE X — TITLE]

1. CAMERA & COMPOSITION
- Camera angle: [wide / medium / close-up / low angle / high angle / side view]. 
  Use a stable, undistorted angle that clearly presents the subject.
- Composition layout: [rule of thirds / centered / panorama]. 
  Keep framing clean and balanced with no dramatic cropping.
- Framing: [how the subject sits in the frame]. 
  Ensure the subject’s body fits naturally inside the frame without clipping or distortion.
- Depth arrangement: clearly separated foreground, midground, and background elements. 
  Maintain correct spatial hierarchy with accurate scale and perspective.

2. ENVIRONMENT
- Setting: [place, time of day, interior/exterior], described simply and consistently.
- Lighting: [soft daylight / warm sunset / diffuse indoor light / overcast]. 
  Lighting must remain soft, even, and appropriate for the scene, without dramatic shadows.
- Atmosphere: [clean, foggy, bright, moody, etc.], matching the reference style’s tone.
- Background complexity: match the reference (simple / medium / detailed). 
  Background must follow the same line density, fill density, and simplification level as the reference style.

3. MAIN CHARACTER
- Pose: [standing / walking / sitting / interacting], drawn correctly with natural posture.
- Expression: [neutral / smiling / focused], consistent with character identity.
- Interaction with environment: [touching an object, looking at something], placed physically correctly with proper scale.
- Clothing: MUST match character lock exactly, including color palette, silhouette, and details. 
  Do not alter hairstyle, accessories, or body shape across scenes.

4. SECONDARY OBJECTS & ACTION
- Vehicles, props, tools, signage, etc., must follow the same stylization rules as the reference style.
- Motion cues: [small movement, gestures, wind, traffic, etc.], kept subtle and clean.
- Object scale MUST follow spatial rules: no oversized or undersized elements.
- All objects must maintain consistent perspective, outline quality, and detail density.

5. STYLE ENFORCEMENT
- Apply exact reference style: linework thickness, color palette, shading type, perspective style, and material rendering.
- Maintain consistent color palette and lighting across all scenes; no deviations.
- Texture density, grain pattern, and edge softness must match the reference exactly.
- Use the same level of line softness, stroke texture, or roughness as the reference.
- Keep background, character, and object details at the same level of simplification as shown in the reference.
- All scenes must share identical visual tone, material treatment, and shading method.
- Uniform art direction across scenes, with no stylistic drift.
- No deviation from reference style; do not add extra details, complexity, or new visual elements.

6. NEGATIVE PROMPT
- inconsistent character identity  
- incorrect character proportions  
- distorted anatomy or broken limbs  
- incorrect object scale (e.g., character larger than a car)  
- broken perspective or impossible angles  
- unwanted changes in clothing or hairstyle  
- mismatched art style within the same scene  
- unintended extra characters or duplicated faces  
- chaotic or cluttered composition (unless references show it)  
- low-quality details such as blurry shapes or noisy textures  
- no clean vector edges unless the reference uses vector lines  
- no high-saturation or neon colors  
- no deviation from the reference style across all scenes  
- no exaggerated gradients, strong shadows, or 3D effects  
- no floating, intersecting, or merged shapes
