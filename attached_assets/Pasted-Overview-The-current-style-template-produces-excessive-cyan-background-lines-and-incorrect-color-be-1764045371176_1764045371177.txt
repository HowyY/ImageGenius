Overview

The current style template produces excessive cyan background lines and incorrect color behavior.
This does not match the actual reference style provided by the user.

The reference style uses:

Deep-blue outlines for both characters and background

Cyan accents only in small areas

Soft cyan→blue gradients on clothing

White skin + simple eyes + simple curved mouth

No shading / No textures

Clean 2D aesthetic

Therefore, the style preset structure must be updated.

1. Required Fixes Summary
Fix #1 — Background lines must be deep-blue

Current prompt encourages cyan outlines → creates messy background.

Replace with:

Background outlines must be mostly deep-blue, not cyan.
Cyan is for accents only.

Fix #2 — Remove strict HEX palette mode (optional)

Strict color palettes reduce model freedom and worsen gradient behavior.

Introduce two modes:
Mode A: Strict Palette (keep HEX list)
Mode B: Loose Palette (describe color family, avoid HEX)
Fix #3 — Update styleKeywords

Needs to specify:

deep-blue outlines

cyan accents

simple facial features

correct gradient behavior

cleaned-up background rules

Fix #4 — Update rules

Add explicit constraint:

Avoid excessive cyan outlines.

Fix #5 — Update negative prompt

Add:

excessive cyan outlines, cyan background lines

2. Updated Style Preset Fields (copy/paste)

Below are corrected versions for your TS/JSON style preset.

2.1 styleKeywords (REPLACE OLD)
clean deep-blue (#002B5C) line art with consistent medium line weight and smooth rounded strokes,
simple dot eyes and small curved mouth, no nose, flat white face area with no shading,
flat 2D illustration with most background outlines also in deep-blue for a unified clean look,
soft cyan-to-blue gradient fills on clothing and main objects, solid deep-blue hair fill,
only small accent marks in cyan (#00AEEF), no textures, no shadows,
simplified anatomy and correct proportions.

2.2 rules (REPLACE OLD)
Use deep-blue outlines for both characters and background to maintain consistency.
Restrict cyan to small accent marks or object fills. Avoid using cyan for large background lines.
Keep backgrounds simple and clean without clutter. Avoid shading and textures.
Preserve flat 2D aesthetic and keep all colors inside the blue–cyan family on a white background.
No text, no watermarks, no extra characters.

2.3 negativePrompt (REPLACE OLD)
excessive cyan outlines, cyan background lines, bad proportions, distorted limbs,
extra faces, inconsistent character identity, blurry, noisy, cluttered background,
text, watermark, logo, signature, mixed art styles, heavy shadows.

3. Colors Section — Two-Preset System
Mode A — Strict Palette (Optional)

(Use only if client branding requires strict colors)

[COLORS]
Use the following palette:
#002B5C, #00AEEF, #0084D7, #FFFFFF.
Follow the palette’s saturation and contrast.

Mode B — Loose Palette (Recommended for This Style)

(Generates results most similar to reference images)

[COLORS]
Use a deep-blue line palette with soft cyan and blue accents.
Apply gentle cyan-to-blue gradient fills on clothing and major objects.
Keep background outlines mostly in deep blue with minimal cyan highlights.
Avoid introducing any colors outside the blue–cyan family.

soft cyan-to-blue gradient fills on clothing and main objects, solid deep-blue hair fill,
only small accent marks in cyan (#00AEEF), no textures, no shadows,
simplified anatomy and correct proportions.

Keep backgrounds simple and clean without clutter. Avoid shading and textures.
Preserve flat 2D aesthetic. No text, no watermarks, no extra characters.

[NEGATIVE]

5. Implementation Instructions for Replit Team
✔ Replace existing styleKeywords, rules, negativePrompt.
✔ Add support for two color modes:

strictPalette (HEX array)

loosePalette (colorDescription text block)

✔ If loosePalette is active → ignore HEX palette.
✔ Ensure background lines default to deep-blue unless user overrides.
✔ Ensure cyan only appears in small accents or gradients.
