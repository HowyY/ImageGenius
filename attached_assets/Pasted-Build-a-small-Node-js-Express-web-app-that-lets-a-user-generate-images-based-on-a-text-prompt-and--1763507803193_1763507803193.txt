Build a small Node.js + Express web app that lets a user generate images based on a text prompt and a selected style.

Requirements:

1. Tech stack
- Use Node.js with Express for the backend.
- Serve a static frontend from a "public" directory.
- Use plain JavaScript (no TypeScript) and no frontend framework is required.

2. Backend structure
- Create an "index.js" file as the main server entry.
- Use `express.json()` to parse JSON requests.
- Serve static files from the "public" folder using `express.static("public")`.
- Listen on `process.env.PORT || 3000`.

3. Style presets
- In "index.js", define a constant array `STYLE_PRESETS` with a few style presets.
- Each style preset should be an object with:
  - id: string (internal ID, e.g. "cool_cyan_lineart")
  - label: string (for UI display, e.g. "Cool cyan vector line art")
  - description: string
  - engines: array of strings (e.g. ["nanobanana", "seeddream"])
  - basePrompt: string (describes the visual style)
- Add at least two styles:
  - "cool_cyan_lineart": clean vector line art, cyan-blue gradient palette, minimal white background.
  - "warm_orange_flat": warm orange/red flat illustration, strong contrast on main subject, almost white background.

4. Backend API endpoints
- `GET /styles`
  - Return the list of style presets as JSON.
  - Only include id, label, description and engines in the response.
- `POST /generate`
  - Request body: `{ "prompt": string, "styleId": string, "engine": string }`.
  - Validate that prompt, styleId and engine are provided.
  - Find the style in `STYLE_PRESETS` by `styleId`.
  - Check that the given engine is included in `style.engines`.
  - Build a `finalPrompt` string that combines the user prompt and the style's `basePrompt`.
  - For now, DO NOT call any external API. Instead, just log the engine and finalPrompt to the console and return a dummy image URL such as `"https://placehold.co/768x432/png?text=Demo+Image"`.
  - Response JSON: `{ "imageUrl": string }`.
- Add clear English comments in the backend to explain each step.

5. Frontend files
- Create `public/index.html` and `public/script.js`.
- `index.html` should:
  - Include a simple form with:
    - A textarea for the user prompt.
    - A `<select>` dropdown for style presets.
    - A `<select>` dropdown for engine with options "nanobanana" and "seeddream".
    - A "Generate image" button.
  - Include a `<div id="status">` to display status messages.
  - Include an `<img id="resultImg">` to display the generated image.
  - Load `script.js` at the end of the body.
  - Use simple but clean styling (can be inline `<style>` in the head).
- `script.js` should:
  - On page load, fetch `/styles` and populate the style `<select>` with options.
  - When the button is clicked, send a POST request to `/generate` with the prompt, selected styleId and engine as JSON.
  - Show "Generating..." while waiting for the response.
  - When the response arrives, if there is an error, show it in the status div.
  - If successful, set `resultImg.src` to the returned `imageUrl` and make the image visible.
  - Include English comments in the code that explain the main steps.

6. General
- All code comments must be in English.
- Make sure the project runs with `node index.js` or `npm start` and opens the web page correctly.
