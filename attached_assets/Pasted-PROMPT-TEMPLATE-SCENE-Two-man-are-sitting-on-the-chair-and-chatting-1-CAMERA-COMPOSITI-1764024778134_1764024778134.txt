PROMPT TEMPLATE

[SCENE — Two man are sitting on the chair and chatting ]

1. CAMERA & COMPOSITION
- Camera angle: stable, undistorted view that clearly presents the subject.
- Composition layout: balanced framing (Cyan Sketchline Vector inspiration).
- Framing: ensure the subject fits naturally without clipping or distortion.
- Depth arrangement: clearly separated foreground, midground, and background with proper scale.

2. ENVIRONMENT
- Setting: Two man are sitting on the chair and chatting .
- Lighting: soft, even light suitable for the scene.
- Atmosphere: match Cyan Sketchline Vector (Hand-drawn navy outlines on bright white space with subtle cyan-to-blue gradients, financial illustration vibe, clean modern linework) tone.
- Background complexity: follow the same simplification level as the reference style.

3. MAIN CHARACTER
- Pose: natural posture derived from the described action.
- Expression: consistent with the character identity implied by the prompt.
- Interaction: accurately placed relative to props/environment with correct scale.
- Clothing: match character lock and respect clean sketch-style vector line art, navy blue outlines, white negative space, subtle cyan to blue gradients for fills, minimalist details, modern financial illustration tone.

4. SECONDARY OBJECTS & ACTION
- Vehicles, props, and signage follow the same stylization rules as Cyan Sketchline Vector.
- Motion cues remain subtle and clean; all objects obey correct scale and perspective.

5. STYLE ENFORCEMENT
- Apply clean sketch-style vector line art, navy blue outlines, white negative space, subtle cyan to blue gradients for fills, minimalist details, modern financial illustration tone.
- Maintain consistent color palette, lighting, texture density, and stroke treatment.
- Keep background, character, and object detail density uniform; no stylistic drift.

6. NEGATIVE PROMPT
- inconsistent character identity
- incorrect character proportions
- distorted anatomy or broken limbs
- incorrect object scale (e.g., character larger than a car)
- broken perspective or impossible angles
- unwanted changes in clothing or hairstyle
- mismatched art style within the same scene
- unintended extra characters or duplicated faces
- chaotic or cluttered composition (unless references show it)
- low-quality details such as blurry shapes or noisy textures
- no clean vector edges unless the reference uses vector lines
- no high-saturation or neon colors
- no deviation from the reference style across all scenes
- no exaggerated gradients, strong shadows, or 3D effects
- no floating, intersecting, or merged shapes
